## Project Goals

#### The company that you work for suspects that credit card distributors have been mailing out cards that have invalid numbers. In this project, you have the role of a clerk who checks if credit cards are valid. Every other clerk currently checks using pencil and paper, but youâ€™ll be optimizing the verification process using your knowledge of functions and loops to handle multiple credit cards at a time. Unlike the other clerks, you can spend the rest of your time relaxing!

As you progress through the steps, use the terminal and console.log() statements to check the output of your loops and functions.

---
#### Check your function using both the provided valid and invalid numbers.
